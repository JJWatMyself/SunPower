# SunPower
This project is for monitoring SunPower solar using PRTG with Perl. Notes in reverse chronology are below

2018/07/28 Some optimizations are now in place:
1) At night, Inverters go into an error state and the reported values remain frozen until state returns to working, e.g. degC reads 30 from dusk to dawn which is simply incorrect. The script will now change these values to zero.  Zero may not be the correct value as at times zero may be a valid value (e.g. in the winter). I'd prefer to store nulls, but that's for another day. I don't have a screenshot of this yet as I made the changes at around 1 AM and it looks a bit messy right now.

2) 'State' has two values that I am aware of so far (working and error).  PRTG doesn't do words, just numbers, so I am now converting to integer and reporting these as 0 (working), 1 (error) or 5 (unknown). 5 is completely made up and signifies that the reported state is a value that is unknown to the script.  The unknown value is not stored because this is not a perfect world and perfection is best applied elsewhere.  Moving on, I  created a custom lookup that maps these integers to words in the UI... Yes, you guessed it: working; error; and unknown. These are associated with PRTG's up, warning and down. If you are new to PRTG, warning and down are alarms that change the color from green to either yellow or red.  These can optionally be used for notifications.  In it's present state a notification would not make sense though as would be generated every day after sunset.  However, if one inverter went into error state during the day, or if all went into error state during the day a notification might be useful. If the panel were covered in snow or leaves, or a random peice of (flying) carpet from the neighbors house you might want to know about it. It would be cool if the neighbor had a flying carpet of course. Ultimate bragging wrights to be the owner of that mythical toy.  TBD if I'll build logic in to inteligently alert to error state during the day  and if that would be a function of the script or PRTG config.  Here is a screenshot that shows the result of the loopkups.  No code has been posted yet.  Nobody is watching yet, so it's a moot point. :P

What's next: more tweaks based on what I see.

2018/07/26 The POC completed on 7/25 took the serial number provided for any inverter and returned all the values for it. The data returned is interesting.  Now I've added logic to take the serial number provided, determine the device type first (Inverter, Power Meter, Supervisor), and then return the appropriate values for it along with the appropriate labels.  Here is a screenshot showing the single script being used to retrieve values for three device types. The plan is to let this sit, gather data for a couple of days and then work to refine the script. No code has been posted yet.

2018/07/25 Proof of concept has been completed. Working to understand all the different elements next and to formulate an overall monitoring template. Note that because this is an evening project, the returned values are for 'night-time' therefore no energy being produced when the screenshot was created.  :) No code has been posted yet.

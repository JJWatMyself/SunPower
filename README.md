# SunPower
This project is for monitoring SunPower solar using PRTG.

Proof of concept has been completed. Working to understand all the different elements next and to formulate an overall monitoring template. Note that becasue this is an evening project, the returned values are for 'night-time' therefore not energy being produced when the screenshot was created.  :)
